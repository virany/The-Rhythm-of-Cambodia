        <h3>What is Cambodian Classical Dancing?</h3>
        <p>
            Cambodian classical dance  is a centuries-old art form that embodies the grace, beauty, and cultural richness of the Khmer people. Traditionally, it was performed in the royal courts; these dances were initially intertwined with Cambodian spirituality and mythology. The dancers would wear intricate costumes and golden headdresses, using precise, elegant gestures and poses to convey stories from ancient Hindu and Buddhist legends. The dances serve not only as entertainment but also as a form of ritual and prayer, believed to bring prosperity and divine blessings to the land. It was even used to convey important life lessons, such as patience, humility and hardwork.
        <br>
        <br>
            The significance of classical dance in Cambodian culture cannot be overstated. Today, it serves as a symbol of national identity and pride. During festivals and religious ceremonies, classical dance connects Cambodians to their ancestors and history, preserving traditions that have been passed down through generations. It also signifies good blessings and wishes to guests at special events.

        <h3>Classical Dance in Historical Context</h3>
        <p>
            When the Pol Pot Regime took over the country, classical dance performances, education, and religion were strictly banned. An estimated 90% of Cambodian artists and arts perished in the 1970s. Since the early 1980’s, classical dance has become an egalitarian art form taught only by being passed down by generation.
