                <!-- Add your short paragraph about yourself here -->
                Thank you so much for checking out my website - “The Rhythm of Cambodia”! My name is Virany Leng, and I'm a 17 year old senior at Edmonds Woodway High School. I’ve lived in Mill Creek, Washington for my entire life, but  I‘ve always had a strong connection to my Cambodian heritage -- which I attest to my lovely grandparents who are committed to youth cultural education and community connection (check out their full story in the “Family Story” tab!) 

                <br> <br>Though I’m not a dancer myself, I’ve always been compelled by classical dances. I wanted to share the beauty and richness that I see in it!  This beauty extends to the strength that is reflected in the arts from the Cambodian people, who have experienced great hardships throughout the years as a result of mass genocide of Cambodian people through the Khmer Rouge (Learn more in the “history” tab). 
                
                I wanted to use “The Rhythm of Cambodia”  as a platform for education and inspiration -- telling the story of my own family and those who share similar stories through an artistic lens and medium. 
                
              <br> <br>  Thank you again for visiting “The Rhythm of Cambodia”, I hope you learned something new from your visit!&#129505;
