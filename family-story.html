            <h3>Their Journey</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                My grandparents' journey from Cambodia to the United States I find to be a testament to their resilience and courage in the face of hardship. In 1981, they fled Cambodia with my mother and aunts, escaping the Khmer Rouge regime. Their journey was fraught with danger as they traveled by foot to reach safety in Thailand. Along the way, they faced numerous challenges, including the heartbreaking losses of family. Despite these tragedies, my grandparents remained determined to secure a better future for their family.
                <br>
                <br>
                In Thailand, they lived as refugees, relying on smuggled jewelry and goods for survival. Life in the refugee camp was difficult, but it provided a glimmer of hope for a new beginning. After enduring the uncertainty and hardship of camp life, my family was finally able to immigrate to the United States. They settled in Seattle, where my grandfather's pride in his homeland inspired him to establish Wat Khemarak Pothiram, a cultural center dedicated to preserving Cambodian traditions and fostering a sense of community.

            <h3>Wat Khmerak Pothiram</h3>
            <p>Wat Khmerak Pothiram serves as a hub for Cambodian culture in Seattle. It is a place where the younger generation can learn about their heritage, and older generations can connect with their community. The center offers cultural, social, religious, educational, and recreational activities for people of all ages and backgrounds. My grandfather's vision was to create a space that would honor Cambodia's rich cultural history but also provide a sense of belonging and support for those who had endured many hardships.

                The cultural center remains a thriving institution today, continuing to fulfill my grandparent's dream of cultural preservation and community building. Wat Khemarak Pothiram has been constructing a new building to accommodate its growing community, with completion anticipated this year! (see photos)
                
                The arts are a vital part of their center, including classical dance. Annually, during the Khmer New Year in April, classical dancers perform a dance for the community!
                
                <br>
                <br>
                My grandparents’ story, like that of many others, is one of strength and resilience. They’ve faced great challenges but have held on to their cultural identity and connection to art. This enduring spirit is what I call 'The Rhythm of Cambodia”!
